# **Algorithms**
*A catalog of classical algorithms, organized by language.*

<br />

### Welcome to Algorithms!
<hr>

This repository serves as a catalog to organize classical algorithms and solutions to staple computer science problems across several languages. Although this repository is public, it is a personal project of my own, and I do not look at pull requests.

<br />

### Get Started 🚀
<hr>

Exploring `Testing_Catalog/`, you will see directories with names corresponding to their respective languages. In each, you will see a subset of the following directories:

`ADT/` - classical, simple abstract datatypes such as the various linked list flavors, and binary trees.

`Graph/` - for traditional path finding and minimal spanning tree algorithms.

`Return/` - for classical computer science problems.

`Search/` - for searching a given target in some data structure, typically an array. This will have two sub-directories to divide prupose, `IntTarget/` and `StrTarget/`.

<br />

### Usage ⚙
<hr>

In any director of your choosing, say `Testing_Catalog/C/Return/` for example, you will see that each problem has its own sub-directory. In such a directory, there will be a collection of files to support the solutions testing and comparison:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `TEST.c` | contains the executable test bench program |
| `tools.c` | printing tools |
| `Makefile` | build/workflow |
| `rng.h` | random number generator for testing |
| `main.h` | tool deceleration and pre-processing |
<br />

Along with the above files are the files containing each solution, named simply after the solution's colloquial name.

<br />

### Technologies 🧰
