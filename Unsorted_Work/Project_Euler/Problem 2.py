# Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
# By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
# 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

# By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million,
# find the sum of the even-valued terms.

 
# Make the Fibonacci Sequence as a list, not exceeding 4*10^6
